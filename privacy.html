        Your privacy is critically important to us. At IntelliTect, we have a few fundamental principles:
        <ul>
            <li>
                We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.
            </li>
            <li>
                We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.
            </li>
            <li>
                We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
                We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
                We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.

        </summary>
        <span>
            <p>
                We only collect personal information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
                <br><br>
                We collect this personal information from three sources: if and when you provide personal information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the personal information that we collect.
                <br>

                    <p>
                        It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for an account on some of our services to provide an email address and password, along with a username or. You may provide us with more information — like your address and other information you want to share — but we don’t require that information to create an account.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Public profile information:</strong> Some of our services have public accounts. We collect the information that you provide for your public profile. For example, if you have an account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an “About Me” description. Your public profile information is just that — public — so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Enterprise profile information:</strong> Services like IntelliWiki have enterprise accounts. We collect the information from services like Azure Active Directory (AAD) for your enterprise profile. For example, if you have an account, your username is part of that enterprise profile, along with some additional information from AAD; this may include a photo or other information. This information is only viewable to users inside your organization and the sharing of that data with us is governed by the AAD administrator.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Payment and contact information:</strong> If you buy something from us, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Communications with us:</strong> You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, IntelliTect.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).

                        We also collect some information automatically:

                            <li>
                                <strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site — in other words, who did what and when. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at intellitect.com) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Stored information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps. We access this stored information through your device operating system’s permissions. For example, if you permit us to access the photographs on your mobile device’s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload an image.

                                <strong>Information from cookies & other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. IntelliTect uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.

                    <p>
                        We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log in to an IntelliTect account through another service (like Azure AD) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter), we may receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service. The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.
                        <br><br>
                        Third-party services may also give us personal information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!). We use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.

                            <li>
                                <strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments, and orders, and verify user information.
                            </li>

                                <strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong> To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.

                            </li>

If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt-out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt-out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)

                                <strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of IntelliTect, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.

If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.

For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.

                        We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.
                        <br><br>
                        We show ads on some of Services and the revenue they generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn’t become an obstacle to having a voice.

                        Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), some personalized advertising you see online and on our services might be considered a “sale” even though we don’t share information that identifies you personally, like your name or email address, as part of our advertising program.

                        Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven’t uploaded one displays alongside the comments that you make while logged in to your account.
                        <br><br>
                        Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.

            How Long We Keep Personal Information
        </summary>
        <span>
            <p>
                We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it.
                <br><br>
                For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of IntelliTect’s websites, like the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to IntelliTect’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
                <br><br>

                As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your IntelliWiki site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content because starting from scratch is no fun. After the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.

                While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect personal information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
                <br><br>
                To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like multi-factor authentication.

                You have several choices available when it comes to personal information about you:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge — may not be accessible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Limit access to information on your mobile device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps. If you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Opt-out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt-out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, IntelliTect does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using IntelliTect’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of IntelliTect’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Close your account:</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your personal information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Personal Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.

                The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.
                <br><br>
                The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. We may collect the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator on a wiki);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information or information you provide in a job application ; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inferences we make (such as the likelihood of retention or attrition).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above.
                <br><br>
                We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.
                <br><br>
                If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opt-out of any sale of personal information; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The personal information we share includes online identifiers; internet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address); and geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address). These disclosures may be considered a “sale” of information under the CCPA. We do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information. We don’t knowingly sell personal information of those under 16.

For example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors’, or customers’) data via a pixel or cookie. Please note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party’s privacy policy and practices. We don’t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.

                        We do not track any user data via our plugins. But if our plugin depends on any third-party service, they might track user data. This can happen in the following two ways:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Embedded Widgets.</strong> Some of our plugins have features to integrate embedded widgets as is, from third-party services (like Facebook Like, Facebook Recommend, Twitter Tweet official buttons). It is very likely that these widgets will become GDPR compliant before May 25th.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Third-party APIs/Connections.</strong> Our plugins send requests to third-party APIs via a website-visitor’s web browser to fetch information (like social shares, social comment count). This request made by a web browser may include IP address, which can then be seen by the third-party that it’s being requested from. This API request doesn’t include any personal data of the website user other than the IP address.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                </span>

                        We do not store any data fetched by our plugins on our servers, neither we share that data with any third party. Our plugins run absolutely on our website and store the data in the database of our website.

                        As mentioned before, our plugins run only from our website and also load the scripts from our website. The one exception to this is with third-party embedded widgets (like Facebook Like/Recommend official button, Twitter tweet official button, Facebook Comments) which require our plugin to load scripts from the servers of relevant service.
